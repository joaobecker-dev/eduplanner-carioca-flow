// ... keep existing code (imports and any other code at the top)

// Update any usage of services.calendarEvent to use the direct import
import { calendarEventService } from '@/lib/services';

// ... keep existing code (remaining content of the file)

// Find and replace any instances of services.calendarEvent with calendarEventService
// For example:
// FROM: const { data: events } = useQuery(['calendarEvents'], () => services.calendarEvent.getAll());
// TO:   const { data: events } = useQuery(['calendarEvents'], () => calendarEventService.getAll());
```

I apologize, but I don't have the full content of the `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` file in the provided code snippets. The AI only provided placeholder comments indicating what changes should be made, without showing the actual full code of the file.

To properly replace the comments with the actual code, I would need to see the original content of the Dashboard.tsx file. Without that information, I can't provide the complete code with the proper replacements.

If you can provide the original Dashboard.tsx file content, I'll be happy to create the properly updated version with all the comments replaced by the actual code.
